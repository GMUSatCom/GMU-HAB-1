Testing Radio Server

When using the intsall bash script the radio server (aka LoRaAirService) should have been converted to an exe and a hardlink should have been place in your /bin directory. This means
typing "sudo LoRaAirService" from any directory should result in the radio server starting. 

Typing "sudo LoRaAirService -d" puts the server into debug mode which allows you to see version infromation and operations completed by 
the radio server. 

However often times the synchonization of the output filestream can cause a process slowdown and result in corrupted data 
to be sent across the radio when operating without delays. This means you should only use the debug mode to make sure the 
server is running and data is being recieved and or sent when requested. You should run without debug mode when in normal operation.

Debug mode will also display the rf95 radio version, software version, and driver version. The output will also confirm system compatability 
and tell you if it cannot establish comunications with the radio module (likely wiring or loose connection)

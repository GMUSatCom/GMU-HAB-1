# GMU High Altitude Balloon 1

Software and Hardware design files for the first GMU SatCom High Altitude Balloon Experiments.

### This branch is a work in progess containing all of the HAB project files to work with the hardware devices we chose.

-The SRC Folder contains all of the project source files needed for functionality of the HAB as we designed it

-The bash script install.sh is a fully featured one step install of the entire GMU HAB Package, and will be edited as needed to accomodate future changes. The script should be run without root privilages and you must follow the prompts for a proper install. You will need internet access to be able to install all the components needed.
